# Halite-Algorithm-Design-Project
Implemented in C++ a Halite bot using algorithm design techniques such as Divide and Conquer, Greedy and Dynamic Programming.

The goal of the implementation is to efficiently save the bot's strength such that the highest score cells will be attacked first.

A greedy approach was used for achieving this functionality.

Obtained the 1st prize of the Champions League Competition which was hosted by ACS-UPB.
