# 2016-Halite-Algorithm-Design-Project
Implemented in C++ a Halite bot using algorithm design techniques such as Divide and Conquer, Greedy and Dynamic Programming.

The goal of the implementation is to efficiently save [1] the bot's strength such that the highest score cells will be attacked first.

Obtained the 1st prize of the Champions League Competition which was hosted by ACS-UPB.

Credits to [Andrei Buhnici](https://github.com/AndreiBuhnici) and [Alexandru Bala](https://github.com/alex-constantin) for giving me some advices and ideas.

[1]: A greedy approach was used for achieving this functionality.
